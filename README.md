## Overview of the analysis

### Bobby's manager has given us a task to determine the number of retiring employees and to identify who is in the mentorship program. Not only that, we will need to figure out our current employees

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
