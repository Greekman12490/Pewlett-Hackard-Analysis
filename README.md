# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

### Bobby's manager has given us a task to determine the number of retiring employees and to identify who is in the mentorship program. Not only that, we will need to figure out our current employees

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
