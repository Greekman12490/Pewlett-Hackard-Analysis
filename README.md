  * At least ninety-thousand, three hundred and ninety-eight people are retiring (90,398)

## Summary
* How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? 
* * Ninety-thousand, three hundred and ninety-eight people are retiring (90,398)
* Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
* * No, with only one thousand, nine hundred and forty retirees (1,940), one retiree will have to mentor at least five people. If this the route wants to take, they can, but some new employees could be neglected.
